Introduction

This project includes the lisp source code for the lisp-addict
project.  It also includes the development tools for communicating
with the emulated Palm device from emacs.

Install

You need to edit the src/config.bash file for your environment.  Refer
to src/config.bash.sample.

$ cp src/config.bash.sample src/config.bash
$ emacs src/config.bash

You must have the Go language tools installed.  See http://golang.org.
Now build the tools that are written in Go:

$ ./refresh.bash

Running

Make sure the emulator is running.  The code assumes we can connect to
it at 192.168.2.1.  You will want one terminal to run the interaction
server in.  And you will want to have a separate terminal or window
for emacs to run in.  In the interaction server terminal, run
./connect.bash.  In your emacs session, load src/lisp-substance.el.
Now open src/boot.lisp.  Place the cursor on an expression and press
C-c C-e.  The expression should be evaluated and you should see some
output appear in the interaction server's terminal.  You can use C-c
C-x to evaluate the expression before point.  You can also evaluate
code from the command line using bin/lispin.  Try this:

$ echo '(+ 36 64)' | bin/lispin
